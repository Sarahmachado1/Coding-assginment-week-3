     <h3> Josh</h3>
     <p> This page is dedicated to my brother Josh. He is 30 mins younger than Noah but he definitly has the older soul. Josh is extremely talented when it comes to music.
       He has the voice of an angel and is very well spoken. But above all he knows his worth and doesn't let it get to his head.
       Loyaltiy is another powerful qualtiy Josh holds and you can see he wears it with pride as he should. </p>
